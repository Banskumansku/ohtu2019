The point of Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel
is to conduct process discussions in a fast format that's also 
the same everytime to easily follow what positive changes have actually
followed from the actions points gathered from the meeting.

The point of Glad, Sad, Mad is the same as the above one, but just in a leaner
format and more flexibility for free discussion. Glad is for things going okay, 
sad is for slowing but not necessarily harming things and mad is for 
things that should be fixed immediatly
